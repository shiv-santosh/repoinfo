# repo-info

Problem Statement:
Input: User can input a link to any public GitHub repository  

Output : UI that displays a table with the following information -  
  - Total number of open issues 
  - Number of open issues that were opened in the last 24 hours 
  - Number of open issues that were opened more than 24 hours ago but less than 7 days ago 
  - Number of open issues that were opened more than 7 days ago   

Space for improvement:
  -> Pagination for issues list
  -> Features to perform git actions that are capabale using the github API
  -> Two factor authentication in addition to basic authentication
  -> Overall better UI
